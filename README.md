This repo contains open-source specs allowing you to completely reproduce the Space Palette Pro,
a visual music instrument on which you play music and graphics simultaneously by finger painting on
pressure sensitive pads.  Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1x5BrCuc9yP6Z52XA">photos and videos</a> from a recent event where it was enjoyed.  Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/HDtxEyCI_zc?t=362">improvised performance</a> using it.

<h1>Building your own Space Palette Pro</h1>
This repo contains all the information needed to building a complete instrument:
<p>
<ul>
<li>DXF data for cutting the wood pieces of the base, monitor, and controller.
<li>A list of everything you need: electronics, hardware, software
<li>Instructions for putting together the base, monitor, and controller
<li>Installer for the open-source software (<a href="https://github.com/vizicist/palette">github.com/vizicist/palette</a>)
<li>Instructions for installing and configuring all the software
</ul>
<p>
The cost of all the <a href="doc/parts.pdf">raw materials</a> for an uncompromised and complete instrument
including the computer is around $8K.
This is no-compromise single-item pricing of materials - cost-reductions
and other adjustments are certainly possible.
For example, the $630 speaker system is unnecessary
if you already have an amplifier and speakers.
Four sets of headphones and a headphone amp may not be needed either.
You might have access to a large CNC machine so you can avoid
paying someone else to CNC all the wood.
<p>
The cost of the controller by itself (including 4 Morphs,
a touchscreen, misc. parts, commercial software, and wood) is around $3K.
The controller alone would be appropriate if you didn't want the base
or monitor enclosures, and you wanted to use an existing
(sufficiently powerful) computer and output monitor.
