This repo contains open-source specs allowing you to completely reproduce the Space Palette Pro,
a visual music instrument on which you play music and graphics simultaneously by finger painting on
pressure sensitive pads.  Here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1x5BrCuc9yP6Z52XA">photos and videos</a> from a recent event where it was enjoyed.  Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/HDtxEyCI_zc?t=362">improvised performance</a> using it.
This repo contains:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A list of everything you need: electronics, software, hardware (all the way down to the bolts)
<li>The open-source Palette software (from <a href="https://github.com/vizicist/palette">github.com/vizicist/palette</a>)
<li>DXF data for CNC cutting the pieces of the three enclosures: controller, base, and monitor.
<li>Instructions for putting it all together.
</ul>

<p>
While this documentation and the Palette software are open source, the Space Palette Pro
makes use of specific commercial software that you must have in order to run it at all.
Some people may already have some of that software, but it's unlikely that anyone will
have all of it, so you'll most likely have to spend some money on software, if you want to run a full-fledged Space Palette Pro.

<h2>Getting started with a single Morph as a visuals-only instrument</h2>
<p>
If you have Windows 10 and a Sensel Morph,
you can easily run the Palette software
as a visuals-only instrument with Resolume 7,
without building the complete Space Palette Pro.
It will even work with the demo version of Resolume Avenue or Arena.
Here are the instructions for that:
<a href="https://github.com/vizicist/palette/blob/main/doc/using_resolume.md">https://github.com/vizicist/spacepalettepro/blob/main/doc/using_resolume.md</a>

<h2>Building just the Space Palette Pro controller</h2>
<p>
Here are the instructions for <a href="doc/building_controller.md">building just the controller</a>,
which by itself would work well in many situations, for example doing performances.
In addition to 4 Morphs, you need the wood pieces, 2 USB hubs, the 10.1" touchscreen, and cables.

<h2>Building a complete and standalone Space Palette Pro</h2>
<p>
Here are the instructions for <a href="doc/building.md">building a complete and standalone Space Palette Pro</a> from scratch.
The cost of all the <a href="doc/parts.pdf">raw materials</a> for an uncompromised and complete instrument
including the computer is around $8K.
This is no-compromise single-item pricing of all materials - cost-reductions
and other adjustments are certainly possible.
For example, the speaker system is unnecessary
if you already have an amplifier and speakers.
Four sets of headphones and a headphone amp may not be needed either.
You might have access to a large CNC machine so you can avoid
paying someone else to CNC all the wood.
