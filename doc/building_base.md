<h1>Building the Base of the Space Palette Pro</h1>
<p>
NOTE: the base has been redesigned to be more modular, and these instructions are no longer valid.
Email me@timthompson.com for details about the newer base design.
<p>
These are the steps to building the base,
assuming you've collected all the necessary parts.

Screw 5 furniture pads into the base bottom.  Be careful that the wood screws don't pop out the other side.

Use 1/4-20 1" bolts to attach the L-angle brackets to both of the side panels.
Note carefully which holes in the brackets are used for the bolts.
You will probably want to zoom into (magnify) the pictures here, to make sure you've got it right.
In particular, the middle shelf bracket is pushed a little more toward one side (the front),
compared to the top and bottom brackets.
Note that the orientation of the two side panels is reversed when you add the brackets.

Attach the mid and top shelves to one of the side panels.
Again, note how the middle shelf is pushed toward one side (which is the front of the base),
so that it doesn't collide with the vertical bracket on the other (back) side.
Also note the orientation of the holes in the top shelf.
Assuming the shelves are 1/4" thick, you can use 3/4" bolts rather than 1".

Attach the other side panel to the shelves.

Attach the bottom of the base, with the bolt heads pointing toward the floor.
The bottom is not symmetric, so make sure that the front of the base bottom has a 1/4" gap
(as shown in the second picture)
and the back of the base bottom has a 1/2" gap (as shown in the third picture)

Screw the power strip into the mid shelf, very close to the back side of the base.

Attach the headphone and speaker amps to the top shelf.  These first pictures show 
the 3D printed brackets that you can bolt to the shelf.
Here is the <a href="../stl/amp_bracket_half.stl">STL data for the bracket</a>.

If you can't print the brackets, you can just use zip-ties as these pictures show.

Using the small 8-32 bolts, attach the dual fans to the base back bottom.

Use velcro to attach the keyboard to the monitor/keyboard board.  Use a 5/8" 1/4-20 bolt, the barrel nut, and the small swivel arm with ballhead to attach the screen to the same board.
